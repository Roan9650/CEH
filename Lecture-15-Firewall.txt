
INTRODUCTION TO FIREWALLS , IDS , IPS
======================================

FIREWALLS
==========
A firewall is a component which is used to filter the incoming and outgoing OR the inbound and outbound rules of a particular network. A firewall is having a database of signatures for the data packets moving inside or outside of a Network.

TYPES OF FIREWALLS
===================
1. Softwares Based Firewalls : These are the firewalls which is  in the form of a application or a software which is having a rulesets of Inbound and Outbound Traffic coming from a Network. Eg. Windows Firewalls , LInux Firewalls - IP Tables.

2. Hardware Based Firewalls : A hardware based firewall is a peripheral which is having a system box with a processor and giving us a Configuration Panel and having more advanced features from a Software Based Firewalls.
Eg. Juniper, Sophos, Endian etc.

IDS
===
IDS stands Intrusion DEtection System, it is a software or a hardware based program which detects every suspicious activity and create a log for it. It can also create the logs and send immediately to the Network Administrator so that they can find out that there is a Intruder in our network. 
It can be determined in different types such as NIDS (Network IDS),  HIDS (Host IDS), WIDS(Wireless IDS) etc

IPS
===
IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System, it acts and works by preventing the intruders which have been doing malicious and illegal activities in the Network or with there clients immediately.

EG. of IDS and IPS - SNORT etc.

HONEYPOTS
=========
A honeypot is a attracting technique to fetch and traps a Hacker, Attacker or a victim which can be a WEb Application, a   Network System or a Access Point(Wireless Connection) which seems like absolutely normal but is created to trap the Attackers.
