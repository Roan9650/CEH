#-----------------Vulnerability Analysis---------------#

Vulnerability Analysis is a part of the scanning phase. Vulnerablility Assessment can be defined as a process of examination, discovery & identification of system & application security measures & weaknesses.

Types Of  VA:-
--------------------
Vulnerability Accessment can be done via different Types:-
	1. Active Assessment
	2. Passive Assessment
	3. External Assessment
	4. Internal Assessment

Other Types of Vulnerability Asssessment:-
	1. Application Assessment
	2. Host-based Assessment
	3. Network Based Assessment
	4. Wireless Network Assessment


Active Assessment:- It is the process of VA which includes actively sending requests to the live network & examining the responses.

Passive Assessment:- It is the process of VA which usually includes packet sniffing to discover vulnerablities, running services, open ports & other informaton.

External Assessment:- In this Assessment Phase VA can be categorized is an External Assessment & to find out vulnerabilities to exploit them from outside.

Internal Assessment:- This is another technique to find vulnerabilities & includes discovering vulnerabilities by scanning internal network & infrastructure.


Life Cycle of  VA:-
------------------------
For VA, Every Hackers must need to follow the life cycle of VA includes Some Phases.
	1. Creating Baseline
	2. Vulnerability Assessment
	3. Risk Assessment	
	4. Remediation
	5. Verification
	6. Monitor

Creating Baseline:- It is a pre-assessment phase of the vulnerability assessment life cycle in which pentester or network administrator who is performing assessment identifies the nature of the corporate network, the applications & services. He creates an inventory of all resources & assests which helps to manage, prioritize the assessment.

Vulnerability Assessment:- VA Phase is focused on asssessment of the target. The assessment process includes examination & inspection of security measures such as physical security as well as security policies & controls.

Risk Assessment:- Risk Assessment includes scoping these identified vulnerablities & their impact on the corporate network or an organization.

Remediation:- Remediation phase includes remedial actions for these detected vulnerabilities. High priority vulnerablities are addressed first because they can cause a huge impact.

Verification:- Verification Phase ensures that all vulnerabilities in an enviornment are eliminated.

Monitor:- Monitoring phase includes monitoring the network traffic & System behaviours for any intrusion.


Vulnerability Scoring Systems:-
----------------------------------------------
1. Comman Vulnerability Scoring Systems (CVSS):-
	The CVSS provied a way to capture the principal characteristics of vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity.

Security 			Base Score Rating
None			0.0
Low			0.1 - 3.9
Medium			4.0 - 6.9
High			7.0 - 8.9
Critical			9.0 - 10.0


2.  Common Vulnerabilities Exposure (CVE):-
	The CVE is another Plateform where you can find the information about vulnerabilities. CVE maintain the list of known vulnerabilities including an identification number & description of known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

3. National Vulnerability Database (NVD):-
	National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data. This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance.

Vulnerability Assessment Tools:-
-----------------------------------------------
There are multiple tools are available which works to find out vulnerability in Network/ System.
