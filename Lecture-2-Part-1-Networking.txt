What is a Network ?
  
  It is a connection of devices connected together with peripheral devices  to share information is known as a network

                                       *nodes=computers=hops*

Packet

->Packets are envelopes of information that carry your data in pieces over a network 

Network Interface

-> It is point of connection or an interface in machine or any device through which the device is able to connect 
		
			Example
						WIFI CARD
						OR LAN CABLE/ETHERNET

Types of Network
	
	LAN -> Local Area Network
	WAN -> Wide Area Network
	MAN -> MetroPloitan Area Network

	PAN -> Personal Area Network
	SAN -> Storage Area Network

Network Topologies
 Topologies is a logical sequence which define or depict how devices/nodes are connected in a network

 1 BUS TOPOLOGY->serial connection
 2 RING TOPOLOGY->circular connection(serial)
 3 STAR TOPOLOGY->star shaped(one node has other node and that node is the only connection point)
 4 MESH OR HYBRID TOPOLOGY->Interconected nodes does'nt have a parent node.


 			Network Protocols  

    Internet Protocol Suite/TCP/ip- A set of data transfer protocol used by modern networks

 TCP --> Transmission Control Protocol
 HTTP --> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
 UDP --> User Datagram Protocol(used for establishing latency free and loss tolerating connection)
 FTP --> File Transfer Protocol
 SSH --> Secure Shell Protocol
 SMTP --> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
 DHCP --> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
 VoIP --> Voice Over Internet Protocol
 POP3 --> Post Office Protocol 3


HTTP -> 80
HTTPS -> 443
SMTP 25
FTP 21
VoIp 465
POP3 110


TCP ->Transmission Control Protocol

TCP is a connection oriented protocol, It means that it is responsible for connection establisment and maintaining that connection until the applications at each end have finished exchanging messages.
-breaks application data into packets so that they can flow through network
-sends and recieves packets to maintain flow control

tcp requires a handshake 
client sync --> server
client <-sync/ack server
client ack-> server



HTTP ->Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

It is protocol used by world wide web and it defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and what action webserver and browsers should take in response to various commands

Example-->A user enters a url in browser-> what it does is the browser sends http command to webserver inorder to request/get the webpage webpage.

HTTPS-Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure


UDP- User datagram protocol
UDP is used to establish a latency free network and it is used in in data transfer,The problem with UDP is that it is a stateless protocol,now stateless means that it does not acknowledge that packets which are being sent and received.(it is used in media streaming)

FTP-File Transfer Protocol
It is a standard protocol which is used for transferring file in a client server computer network.

SSH-Secure Shell Protocol 
It is a protocol which enables secure remote login from one computer to another computer .It works on client server model.

SMTP-Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
It is standard protocol for delivering emails form one email server to another.

Pop3 -> Post office Protocol
It enables client to download email from an email sever.


DHCP-Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

It is network management protocol that assigns ip address to device on a network so that it can communicate with other ip networks

e.g Home Router gives an ipaddress to a device whenever it connects to wifi router


NOTE->>DHCP can be implemented on Home Networks

It can also be implemented on Campus 
It can also be implemented by ISP on regional networks 

Homework -> Go and study DHCP starvation attack(Yersinia) 

Voip-Voice over ip 
used for voice based communications on the internet e.g skype  

WHAT IS AN IP ADDRESS ?

An ip address is a 32 bit unique address assigned to a computer on the internet and is used for communication and identify computers on the internet 
(Just Like an home address)

example 192.168.1.1 -> an ip address
         
         8bit.8bit.8bit.8bit 

   NOW kya hen ye 8 bit ?
   kya hen ye bit
   bit stands for binary digit now what is binary digit , it is the smallest unit of data in a computer.

   A bit can either have value of 0 or 1

   8 bits = 1 byte

   1 killobyte = 1000 bytes
	
	192 = 11000000 in binary
how
1×2^7 + 1×2^6 + 0x2^5 + 0x2^4 + 0x2^3 + 0x2^2 + 0x2^1 + 0x2^0 = 192
1		1		0		0		0		0		0		0	
   
 or 


192.168.32.1

(Binary form)so we have 192=128+64 = 11000000
		168=128+32+8=	   = 10101000
			  32=	   = 00100000
			   1= 	   = 00000001
so we have 
			11000000.10101000.00100000.00000001

128	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
----------------------------------------------------------------
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1





Now ip address
 
 ->IPv4-> 32 bit ->Relies on DHCP  (Only 4.29 billion unique addresses)

 ->IPv6-> 128 bit -> Auto Configured (340 undecillion unique addresses= 340 Trillion Trillion Trillion addresses )


Now the question is -> How 4 billion ip address are enough or were enough for today's world and how did we even we make it so far with only 4 billion ip address and That is with help of NAT or NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION

What is Nat ??

Network Address Translation (NAT) is designed for IP address conservation. It enables private IP networks that use unregistered IP addresses(common personal computers) to connect to the Internet. NAT operates on a router, usually connecting two networks together, and translates the private (not globally unique) addresses in the internal network into legal addresses, before packets are forwarded to another network.
 
Basically, NAT allows a single device, such as a router, to act as an agent between the Internet (or public network) and a local network (or private network), which means that only a single unique IP address is required to represent an entire group of computers to anything outside their network.



An ip address is of two types
1 Private       2 Public

Private Ip address
-> Internal IP address valid on LAN but not on the internet for example
	All the devices connected to your wifi network have recieved a private ip address

There are three Different blocks of ipv4 addresses

		Class A -> 10.0.0.0/8
		(10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)

		Class B -> 172.16.0.0/12
		(172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)

		Class C ->192.168.0.0/16
		(192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)

Public Ip address 
->Public ip address on the other-hand are globally unique and valid on the internet 
Example the ip address assigned to my WAN interface wireless router by ISP
 eg 42.111.108.97


---------------------------------------------
 ->www.whatismyip.com---will show global ip |
 ->ipchicken                                |
 ->ipcow					|
---------------------------------------------




IP SUBNETS:

A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called sub-netting

One network into many networks so that it can be easily managed and be secured


	

DHCP Server:
		Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server
SO 
 every time some device is connected to wifi router an ip address is assigned to the device
 and that assigning of the task is done by dhcp server in wifi router

 The ip address is assigned with a lease (Time limit) to which the ip address will remain functional for a device
   Example 
    			Router Ip address =192.168.15.1

    			 so The router can assign ip address to the devices from 192.168.15.2 to 192.168.15.255 

    			 And This Assigning is done with the help of dhcp server

Class	Address range
Class A	1.0.0.1 to 126.255.255.254
Class B	128.1.0.1 to 191.255.255.254
Class C	192.0.1.1 to 223.255.254.254
